1. ### Agile
    - #### Being Agile
        
        - **Agile**
            > Is often idenfied as the process of defining requirements and solutions through colaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. - ([wikipedia][1]) More commonly **Scrum** is the defacto agile implementation for software development - ([mountaingoat][3])
        
        - **Cross-Functional**
        
            > in regards to teams that contain varied expertise working towards the same goal. - ([wikipedia][4]) In the software development world expertises could include:

            > - Design
            > - Deployment
            > - Front-end
            > - Back-end
            > - Project Management
        
            > While all these team members may not be present for the duration of the project. They will define their own required time on the team acting in a **Self-Organizing** manner. Along with good communication about project goals team weekenesses can be addressed quickly.
        
        - **Self-Organizing**
            > is the process by which individuals focus to solve a problem as a team that defines itself. - ([selforg.pdf][2]) The reality of this is that management will assign resources(humans) based upon the expected difficulty of the development task and its required release date and this team will grow and shrink on its own based upon need. 
        
        - The _Twitter_ example
            > Providing no real proof that twitter is agile let us assume that _Twitter_ employs an agile process. And has a defined goal of providing a feature to reduce the number of out of focus "Selfie's" are posted on their network by
