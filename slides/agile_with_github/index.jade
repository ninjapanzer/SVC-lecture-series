                - School has a couple of purposes in our society.
                - One is for obvious and righteous expansion of our minds
                - The other is the flat truth that by completing these courses we will have provied ourselves worthy of employment in our chosen field
                - In reality what you do at school defines what you do immediately after graduation
                - There are wonderful opportunities and the competition will be high so School is the best place to start marketing yourself

                - If you are not learning something at work it is likely time to move on.
                - When you go out there for that first job don't get the job that has all the things you already know
                - Strive for that job that stretches your limits and gives your a reason to make your a better developer
                - I went to work directly after I graduated at a small web development agency.
                - I was only able to take that job because I worked on web projects as as student prior to graduation

              - Teams that contain varied expertise working towards the same goal. - ([wikipedia][4])

              - In the software development world expertises could include:
        
                - UX
                - Design
                - Deployment
                - Front-end
                - Back-end
          
              - These team members may not be present for the duration of the project. 
              They will define their own required time on the team acting in a **[Self-Organizing][1]** manner. 
              Along with good communication about project goals team weekenesses can be addressed quickly.
