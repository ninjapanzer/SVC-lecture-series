## Overview
### Goals
- Expose students to techniques and ideologies used in the open source community and small to medium sized companies.
- Expose students of other departments to involve themselves in Computer Science
- Promote open source involvement and values.
- Make students more competitive earlier in their careers by inspiring them to become involved in social coding and take entrepreneurial risks.

### Process
Using my own personal work experience as a standard in conjuction faculty feedback. I plan to create a well structued and departmentally relevant series of lectures and interactive workshops that will aid the preperation of students for the job market.

#### Lectures
